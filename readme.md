# Overview
This project was created by Francois Dickey and Etienne Tremblay in 2001.

It was a CEGEP chemistry cornerstone project which consisted of writing a software
to be used by the CEGEP to operate a Spectronic 1001 in Windows 95 (As the official software was for DOS only).

The software was thus created with the aim of running in Windows 95, and to capture UV and Visible spectrometers via the Spectronic 1001's com port.

# Today's purpose

I recently a Spectronic 1001 on EBay for the purpose of quantifying diacetyl levels in homebrew beer, as it is a great indicator of the quality of the
fermentation.

It can also be used for other quality assurance measurements in homebrewing.  See the book "Yeast: The practical guide" for more details!
